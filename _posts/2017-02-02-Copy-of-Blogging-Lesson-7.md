    <td>I used online tutorials to get interesting ideas to code. I also got my family to test out the program. This helped a lot as small mistakes that I didn't see, were spotted and corrected.</td>

    <td>I think I could have done better if I had not just kept my concentration and not talked. The whole class was noisy and this resulted in slow progress. However it was better than last week.</td>
